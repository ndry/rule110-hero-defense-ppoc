This playable proof of concept utilizes [rule 110 1d cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110) to achieve elementary emergent gameplay. The game may be genred as some form of turn based hero defense. The center of the universe is occupied by an oscilator. The edges of the universe are generated randomly and occasionally give birth to spaceships which then propagate to the center. Player has to manually edit the world to prevent destructive interaction with the central pattern.
